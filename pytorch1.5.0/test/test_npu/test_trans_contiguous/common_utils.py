r"""Importing this file must **not** initialize CUDA context. test_distributed
relies on this assumption to properly run. This means that when this is imported
no CUDA calls shall be made, including torch.cuda.device_count(), etc.

torch.testing._internal.common_cuda.py can freely initialize CUDA context when imported.
