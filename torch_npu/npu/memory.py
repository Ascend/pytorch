    The return value of this function is a dictionary of statistics, each of
    which is a non-negative integer.
    Core statistics:
    - ``"allocated.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of allocation requests received by the memory allocator.
    - ``"allocated_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of allocated memory.
    - ``"segment.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of reserved segments from ``npuMalloc()``.
    - ``"reserved_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of reserved memory.
    - ``"active.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of active memory blocks.
    - ``"active_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of active memory.
    - ``"inactive_split.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of inactive, non-releasable memory blocks.
    - ``"inactive_split_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of inactive, non-releasable memory.
    For these core statistics, values are broken down as follows.
    Pool type:
    - ``all``: combined statistics across all memory pools.
    - ``large_pool``: statistics for the large allocation pool
      (as of October 2019, for size >= 1MB allocations).
    - ``small_pool``: statistics for the small allocation pool
      (as of October 2019, for size < 1MB allocations).
    Metric type:
    - ``current``: current value of this metric.
    - ``peak``: maximum value of this metric.
    - ``allocated``: historical total increase in this metric.
    - ``freed``: historical total decrease in this metric.
    In addition to the core statistics, we also provide some simple event
    counters:
    - ``"num_alloc_retries"``: number of failed ``npuMalloc`` calls that
      result in a cache flush and retry.
    - ``"num_ooms"``: number of out-of-memory errors thrown.
    The caching allocator can be configured via ENV to not split blocks larger than a
    defined size (see Memory Management section of the Cuda Semantics documentation).
    This helps avoid memory framentation but may have a performance
    penalty. Additional outputs to assist with tuning and evaluating impact:
    - ``"max_split_size"``: blocks above this size will not be split.
    - ``"oversize_allocations.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of over-size allocation requests received by the memory allocator.
    - ``"oversize_segments.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of over-size reserved segments from ``cudaMalloc()``.
