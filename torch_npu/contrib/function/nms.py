    Origin implement from mmdetection is
    https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/mmdet/core/post_processing/bbox_nms.py#L7

    This interface is similar to the original interface, but not exactly the same.

    .. note::
        In the case of dynamic shape, because of the limitation of NPU op, only supports the maximum
        number of categories(nmsed_classes) is 20, and the maximum number of boxes(nmsed_boxes) is 10000.

    Args:
        multi_bboxes (Tensor): shape (n, #class, 4) or (n, 4)
        multi_scores (Tensor): shape (n, #class+1), where the last column
            contains scores of the background class, but this will be ignored.
            On npu, in order to keep the semantics unblocked, we will unify the dimensions
        score_thr (float): bbox threshold, bboxes with scores lower than it
            will not be considered.
        nms_thr (float): NMS IoU threshold. In the original implementation, a dictionary of {"iou_threshold": 0.45}
            was passed, which is simplified here.
        max_num (int): if there are more than max_num bboxes after NMS,
            only top max_num will be kept; if there are less than max_num bboxes after NMS,
            the output will zero pad to max_num. On the NPU, the memory needs to be requested in advance,
            so the current max_num cannot be set to -1 at present
        score_factors (Tensor): The factors multiplied to scores before applying NMS

    Returns:
