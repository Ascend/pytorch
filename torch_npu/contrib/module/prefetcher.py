    Args:
        loder (torch.utils.data.DataLoader or DataLoader like iterator):
            Using to generate inputs after preprocessing.
        stream (torch.npu.Stream): Default None.
            Because of the limitation of NPU's memory mechanism,
            if prefetcher is initialized repeatedly during training,
            a defined stream should be introduced to prevent memory leakage;
            if prefetcher is initialized only once during training,
            a defined stream is not necessary.

    Returns:
        float: tensors of shape (k, 5) and (k, 1). Labels are 0-based.
