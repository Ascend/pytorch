    `pg_guid` is a system generated id, but depending on the mode of PG creation it could be a globally incrementing int
          or a hash of the ranks.  See `_process_group_name` in distributed_c10d.py.
    `desc` is provided by the user (optionally) and should be 'meaningful' (e.g. TP/PP/DP group)
    `ranks` is a list of the 'global ranks' that are members of the PG.

    (pg_guid, desc, ranks) tuples are appended lazily to the flight buffer when `getHCCLComm` is called on a PG and
    the `enabled_` flag is true for that PG.
        - the order of calling (init_process_group, new_group, etc) does not affect the order of the tuples in the list

    Returns:
        `groups`: a groups table where each row is a Group namedtuple.
        `_groups`: a dict that is indexed by pg_guid with Group namedtuple as value.
        `memberships`: a membership table where each row is a Membership namedtuple.
        `_memberships`: a dict that is indexed by pg_guid with set of ranks (int) as value.
